## Background

::: {.callout-note}
**Definition:** Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.

#### Potential benefits from SDOH
- In United States, 3.6 million people did not receive medical care because of transportation barriers [@Wallace2005-yq]
- Hypothetical US income support policies could prevent 12,000 to 32,000 deaths among the lowest-income, working-age adult population [@Avancena2022-lo]
- In Illinois, a 42 percent drop in participants' health care costs almost immediately through a housing support program (Better Health Through Housing) [@noauthor_undated-be]
- SDOH are critical factors for promoting population health and well-being

#### Current efforts on SDOH
- Growing movement to identify and address non-medical, social need of patients in the health care system   
- Various SDOH data are publicly available, especially area/community-level SDOH (US Census Bureau, Area Health Resource Files (AHRF), County Health Ranking (CHR), etc.)   
- Interpreting SDOH is difficult due to the complexity of data, multiple data sources, and the large number of SDOH measurements    
- Developing a composite score for SDOH could be helpful for interpretation

## Research gaps and objectives

- Current exist SDOH composite scores
   - either combined all domains of SDOH into one score (e.g., Area Deprivation Index[@Singh2003-gn], Social Vulnerability Index, SDOHi from BUSPH) 
   - or targeted specific population (e.g., SDOHi from CQL)[@Friedman2020-eq]
- Few composite scores focused on each domain of SDOH 
- This study aims to develop SDOH composite score for each domain (could be narrower) and assess the SDOH composite score in predicting outcomes (e.g., utilization, readmission)

## Intended audience
People who interested in SDOH domain, especially in SDOH composite score.

## Method

Loading packages
```{r}
#| label: "setup"
#| warning: false
library(corrplot)
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)

**Data source:**\
Geo Social Analytic Platform (GSAP) data[@Ballena2019-gx] in 2018, which is county-level data includes 3,220 counties

Data dictionary:
```{r}
dictionary <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Johns Hopkins University/Courses/2nd Year/2nd Quarter/PH.140.840 Statistical Programming Paradigms and Workflows/Project1/Project1/dictionary.csv")
knitr::kable(dictionary)
```

**Statistical analysis:**\
used principal component analysis to classify variables into meaningful group

## Results

Read dataset:
```{r}
housing <- read.csv("~/Downloads/housing.csv")
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
# convert character to numeric
housing <- housing %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(-("geoid")), as.numeric)
sapply(housing, class)
```

```{r}
# detect and delete missing value
sum(is.na(housing))
dim(housing)
housing_clean <- na.omit(housing)
sum(is.na(housing_clean))
dim(housing_clean)
```

```{r}
# feature scale
housing_clean <- housing_clean %>% subset(select = -geoid)
preproc <- preProcess(housing_clean, method=c("range"))
housing_norm <- predict(preproc, housing_clean)
summary(housing_norm)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-mtcars1
#| fig-cap: "Housing variables correlation matrix"
#| warning: false
corr_matrix <- cor(housing_norm)
# correlation plot
corrplot(corr_matrix, method="pie", hc.order = TRUE, type = "upper")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-mtcars2
#| fig-cap: "Scree plot for Factors vs Eigenvalue"
#| warning: false
res.pca <- PCA(housing_norm, ncp = 18, graph = FALSE)
eig.val <- data.frame(get_eigenvalue(res.pca))
ggplot(data=eig.val, aes(x= 1:nrow(eig.val), y=eig.val$eigenvalue)) +
  labs(x = "Diamensions",
       y = "Eigenvalue") +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, col = "red")
```  
  
```{r}
#| label: fig-mtcars3
#| fig-cap: "Scree plot for factors vs. percentage of explained variances"
#| column: margin
print(fviz_eig(res.pca, addlabels = TRUE, ncp = 18))
```
  
```{r}
#| label: fig-mtcars4
#| fig-cap: "Variable quality in each factor"
var <- get_pca_var(res.pca)
corrplot(var$cos2, is.corr=FALSE)
```

::: {.callout-important}
Principal component analysis shows four dimensions/factors are appropriate to explain data variance. These four variables could explain 65.65% of variance of data. However, based on the variable quality graph, we may classify variables into three meaningful components, which could be financial, owener's status, and house condition.   
- **Financial:** Housingvalue, Mortgage, Mortgagecost, Mortgageval, Rentgross, Mortgagetax   
- **Owner's status:** Occupyown, Rentprcinc, Units, Unitsownpop, Vehicle, Occupy    
- **House Condition:** Fuelheat, Kitchen, Plumbing, Room    
- **Non-classified:** Phone, Yr_median
