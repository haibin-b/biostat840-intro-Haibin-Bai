  abstract = "Importance: Income has a negative, nonlinear association with
              all-cause mortality. Income support policies may prevent deaths
              among low-income populations by raising their incomes. Objective:
              To estimate the deaths that could be averted among working-age
              adults age 18 to 64 years with hypothetical income support
              policies in the US. Design Setting and Population: An open,
              multicohort life-table model was developed that simulated
              working-age adults age 18 to 64 years in the US over 5 to 40
              years. Publicly available household income data and previous
              estimates of the income-mortality association were used to
              generate mortality rates by income group. Deterministic
              sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of
              parameter uncertainty and various model assumptions on the
              findings. Interventions: In addition to a no-intervention
              scenario, 4 hypothetical income support policies were modeled:
              universal basic income, modified LIFT Act, poverty alleviation,
              and negative income tax. Main Outcome and Measures: The main
              outcome was the number of deaths averted, which was calculated by
              subtracting the number of deaths experienced in the
              no-intervention scenario from the number of deaths experienced
              with the various income support policies. Results: Base-case
              assumptions used average mortality rates by age, sex, and income
              group, a 20-year time horizon, and a 3-year lag time. Universal
              basic income worth \$12 000 per year per individual was estimated
              to avert the most deaths among working-age adults (42 000-104 000
              per year), followed by a negative income tax that guaranteed an
              income of 133\% of the federal poverty level (19 000-67 000 per
              year). A modified LIFT Act that provided \$6000 to individuals
              with annual household incomes less than \$100 000 was estimated
              to avert 17 000 to 52 000 deaths per year. A targeted approach
              that alleviated poverty was estimated to prevent 12 000 to 32 000
              deaths among the lowest-income, working-age adult population.
              Results were most sensitive to several inputs and assumptions,
              primarily the income-based mortality rates, analytic time
              horizon, and assumed time lag between when a policy was
              implemented and when individuals experienced the mortality
              benefit of having higher incomes. Conclusions and Relevance: In
              this modeling study, 4 hypothetical income support policies were
              estimated to avert thousands of deaths among working-age US
              adults every year. Additional research is needed to understand
              the true association of income gains with mortality. Discussions
              about the costs and benefits of income support policies should
              include potential gains in health.",

               Two Missing Links",
  author    = "Wallace, Richard and Hughes-Cromwick, Paul and Mull, Hillary and
               Khasnabis, Snehamay",
  abstract  = "Although lack of access to nonemergency medical transportation
               (NEMT) is a barrier to health care, national transportation and
               health care surveys have not comprehensively addressed that
               link. Nationally representative studies have not investigated
               the magnitude of the access problem or the characteristics of
               the population that experiences access problems. The current
               study, relying primarily on national health care studies, seeks
               to address both of those shortcomings. Results indicate that
               about 3.6 million Americans do not obtain medical care because
               of a lack of transportation in a given year. On average, they
               are disproportionately female, poorer, and older; have less
               education; and are more likely to be members of a minority group
               than those who obtain care. Although such adults are spread
               across urban and rural areas much like the general population,
               children lacking transportation are more concentrated in urban
               areas. In addition, these 3.6 million experience multiple
               conditions at a much higher rate than do their peers. Many
               conditions that they face, however, can be managed if
               appropriate care is made available. For some conditions, this
               care is cost-effective and results in health care cost savings
               that outweigh added transportation costs. Thus, it is found that
               great opportunity exists to achieve net societal benefits and to
               improve the quality of life of this population by increasing its
               access to NEMT. Furthermore, modifications to national health
               care and transportation data sets are recommended to allow more
               direct assessment of this problem.",

@ARTICLE{Friedman2020-eq,
  title    = "The Social Determinants of Health Index",
  author   = "Friedman, Carli",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Health disparities are avoidable differences that
              disproportionately impact certain groups. Health equity demands
              attention to social determinants of health (SDOH), particularly
              for people with disabilities who often have poorer outcomes and
              face more health inequities than nondisabled peers. OBJECTIVE:
              The aim of this study was to develop a Social Determinants of
              Health Index for people with disabilities that utilizes personal
              outcomes. The Index is aimed at helping disability service
              providers examine the SDOH of those they support, to arm them
              with more information to provide targeted services and supports.
              METHOD: We ran an exploratory factor analysis of Personal Outcome
              Measures interviews with 1,078 people with disabilities from 2017
              to compute composite scores for the factors underlying the model.
              RESULTS: Findings revealed the Social Determinants of Health
              Index had 3 underlying factors: choice and engagement;
              person-centeredness; and health and safety. Choice and engagement
              are often inextricably linked as choice, self-determination, and
              empowerment play a key role in the social inclusion of people
              with disabilities. Services being person-centered are not only a
              right and requirement of home- and community-based services, but
              rights should also be person-centered-each person decides which
              rights are the most important to them. Finally, the third factor
              recognizes health and safety as foundational parts of health
              outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of the Social Determinants of
              Health Index for people with disabilities, which utilizes
              person-centered outcomes, ultimately aims to reduce health
              disparities. Attention to SDOH can promote good health for all.

  author    = "Singh, Gopal K",
  abstract  = "Objectives. This study examined age-, sex-, and race-specific
               gradients in US mortality by area deprivation between 1969 and
               1998. Methods. A census-based area deprivation index was linked
               to county mortality data. Results. Area deprivation gradients in
               US mortality increased substantially during 1969 through 1998.
               The gradients were steepest for men and women aged 25 to 44
               years and those younger than 25 years, with higher mortality
               rates observed in more deprived areas. Although area gradients
               were less pronounced for women in each age group, they rose
               sharply for women aged 25 to 44 and 45 to 64 years. Conclusions.
               Areal inequalities in mortality widened because of slower
               mortality declines in more deprived areas. Future research needs
               to examine population-level social, behavioral, and medical care
               factors that may account for the increasing gradient.",
