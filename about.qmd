Iâ€™m a second-year Master's student in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics and Data Science](http://dhsi.med.jhmi.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins School of Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/). I am interested in health service research, health informatics research, machine learning, and data visualization. My research interest is focusing on health service research. Specifically, development of Social Determinant of Health (SDOH) composite score, score-based prediction modeling, and geo-based visualization.

Past projects have focused on health service research. Used South Korea health insurance claim data to distribute healthcare resources and used mortality/readmission predictive model to assess association between healthcare resources between mortality/readmission. Additionally, used multi-level regression model to assess geo-based association.
