    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nDefinition: Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Health People 2030\n\n\n\n\n\nIn United States, 3.6 million people did not receive medical care because of transportation barriers (Wallace et al. 2005)\nHypothetical US income support policies could prevent 12,000 to 32,000 deaths among the lowest-income, working-age adult population (Avanceña et al. 2022)\nIn Illinois, a 42 percent drop in participants’ health care costs almost immediately through a housing support program (Better Health Through Housing) (“Social Determinants of Health Series: Housing and the Role of Hospitals,” n.d.)\nSDOH are critical factors for promoting population health and well-being\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing movement to identify and address non-medical, social need of patients in the health care system\n\nVarious SDOH data are publicly available, especially area/community-level SDOH (US Census Bureau, Area Health Resource Files (AHRF), County Health Ranking (CHR), etc.)\n\nInterpreting SDOH is difficult due to the complexity of data, multiple data sources, and the large number of SDOH measurements\n\nDeveloping a composite score for SDOH could be helpful for interpretation"
